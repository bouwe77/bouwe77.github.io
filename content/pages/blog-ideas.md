# Content creation

- Goals for content creation: What do you want to achieve?

- Curious Coders Chronicles podcasting

# Coding

- Using application code in tests, so tests always pass (including constant values for example)

- Throwing errors, just to be sure (errors and logging are for runtime, not for during develop time)

# React

- Optimization without memoization

- useState updater form (kan ik een bug bedenken en hiermee fixen?)
