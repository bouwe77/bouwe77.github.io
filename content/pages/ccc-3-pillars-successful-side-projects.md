The 3 Pillars of Successful Side Projects

# Successful?

- Shipping a product, get people to use it, make money?

- Contribute to open source, become part of (or even build) a community?

- Or personal branding, become well known, as a benefit to your career?

- For me it is more about learning, and having fun.

- More on that in a minute, but I think it is important to realize it does not matter

- I've never really finished a side project, or have something that is used by others, and requires maintenance or new features.

- And it does not even matter to have side projects, it is not required, you can also just do coding for work, or not at all.

# The pillars

So now you know, for me, successful means fun and learning.

Which are my first 2 pillars

... examples of fun and educational side projects...

Now I need one final pillar, and I think it is experience. 

- Choose the stack I want
- Freedom
- Ridiculous combinations
- Over-engineering
- It can even get you a job
