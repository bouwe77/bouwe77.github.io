As I mentioned before I use the [gatsby-starter-lumen] for my blog. The layout is very
clean and I thought the few improvements I wanted to do were very easy. However, this
was not the case. The code of this starter is very inflexible, it took me too much effort
to change small things. And my beloved CodeSandbox didn't work with it either.

So I decided to look for a new starter and I found the [gatsby-starter-minimal-blog].
This starter also has a very clean layout, but the code is so much better. I did some
minor tweaks to the source code and it went like a breeze.

Also, the blog post files are not Markdown files, but [MDX] files. MDX is a format that
let's you write Markdown and JSX in one file, which means you are very flexible when
writing blog posts.

And last but not least, I can use CodeSandbox again!

A feature I am missing is categories, although it supports tags. Oh well,
you can't have everything, I am very happy with this upgrade.
