## Resources

2. [The TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)

## Notes

### Any, unknown, never

#### Notes

According to TypeScript docs:
* any (allow anything)
* unknown (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is)
* never (itâ€™s not possible that this type could happen)

According to David K. Piano (https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1437393026180079621):
* `unknown` = "don't know"
* `any` = "don't care"
* `never` = "don't want"
* `void` = "don't return"

#### To Do

- [ ] Practice in TS Playground: ...
- [ ] Know and being able to explain use cases
