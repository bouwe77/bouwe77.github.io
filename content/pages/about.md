Hi, I am Bouwe Westerdijk, an enthusiastic and experienced software engineer at
<a href="https://webinargeek.com" target="_blank">WebinarGeek</a> in The Netherlands.

I like learning new technologies and sharing my learning by <a href="/blog">blogging</a>, <a href="/videos">streaming</a>, and
<a href="/speaking">speaking</a>.

Professionally I am working with React, TypeScript, XState, and React Testing Library.

When I feel like coding in my free time, I do frontend development with Elm, or backend development with Node. Currently I am working on <a href="https://github.com/bouwe77/temba" target="_blank">Temba</a>, an open source library to quickly spin up an HTTP API within seconds.

You can contact me on
