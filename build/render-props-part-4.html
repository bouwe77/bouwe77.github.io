            <div><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>I wrote several blog posts about my learning process of the render props pattern.
With every blog post I learned something new, but also made mistakes. But that's
what learning is about. And because I am learning in public, it kind of forces
me to fix things that could be better.</p>
<p>In my <a href="/render-props-part-iii-a-flexible-and-reusable-toggle-component">previous post</a> (part 3) about the render props pattern, I thought I kind of
finished my implementation of the <code>Toggle</code> component. However, I used the <code>useEffect</code>
hook, which is a great learning experience, but now, a few months later, I realized
in this case, it is not necessary to use <code>useEffect</code> for what I wanted to achieve.</p>
<p>In this blog post I will explain you why.</p>
<p><strong>Do you haz teh codez?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, this is my <code>Toggle</code> component from <a href="/render-props-part-iii-a-flexible-and-reusable-toggle-component">part 3</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function Toggle({ render, onToggle }) {
  const [on, setOn] = useState(false);

  function doToggle() {
    setOn(!on);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    if (onToggle) onToggle(on);
  }, [on]);

  return &#x3C;>{render(doToggle)}&#x3C;/>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Toggle</code> component receives two props. The first is the <code>render</code> prop, which
is the function that renders the UI. That <code>render</code> function is returned by the
<code>Toggle</code> component, because that is what React components do, they always return
a piece of UI.</p>
<p>When calling the <code>render</code> function in the return the <code>doToggle</code> function is passed.
That function is called when the user toggles the UI. When a toggle takes place
the <code>on</code> state of the <code>Toggle</code> component is inversed, true becomes false and false
becomes true.</p>
<p>The <code>useEffect</code> responds to the fact the value of the <code>on</code> state and calls the second
prop that is passed in the <code>Toggle</code> component: the <code>onToggle</code>. This is a callback
function passed by the component that uses the <code>Toggle</code> component. What typically happens
when calling the <code>onToggle</code> is that there happens some kind of state change in the
component that uses the <code>Toggle</code> component.</p>
<p><strong>Why useEffect?</strong></p>
<p>As soon as the <code>on</code> state value changes, I use the <code>useEffect</code> to pass that new state
value to the callback function so the parent component also can use that new value.</p>
<p>I thought I had to "wait" for the state change to really have happened before I
could call the callback function, because that's the moment I know the new state
value for sure.</p>
<p>However, at the moment I set the new <code>on</code> value with <code>setOn</code>, I already know the
new value! It's right there in the code where I pass it to <code>setOn</code>! 8-|</p>
<p>DOH!!!</p>
<p>So why not call the callback right away with that same value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function Toggle({ render, onToggle }) {
  const [on, setOn] = useState(false);

  function doToggle() {
    setOn(!on);
    onToggle(!on);
  }

  return &#x3C;>{render(doToggle)}&#x3C;/>;
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh, and by the way...</strong>
There was also a bug in my <code>useEffect</code> code. The <code>useEffect</code> is calling the <code>onToggle</code>
callback function which makes it a dependency and therefore should be added to
the dependency array. However, we've removed the <code>useEffect</code> entirely, so that's
not an issue anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How I figured this out</strong></p>
<p>After writing <a href="/render-props-part-iii-a-flexible-and-reusable-toggle-component">part 3</a> it kept on disturbing me I had to use such a complicated
solution for such a common and simple problem. So I started googling arround and
stumbled upon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/a3y76f/react_hooks_setstate_gotcha/eba1fh0/">this Reddit post</a>.</p>
<p>There Mr Dan Abramov himself explains why you can not have the new state value right
away. And also that this is not a problem most of the times as you define the new state
value yourself and then can do with it whatever you want.</p>
<p>He explains with code that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

function handleClick() {
  setCount(42);
  // you can't expect this to somehow immediately change the count, we even declared it with const :-)
  console.log(count); // 0
  // but on next render, count will be 42
}
</code></pre>
<p>I think the code comments explain a lot. :)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>By writing this blog I not only learned something new, I also fixed crappy code and, last
but not least, have a better understanding of the <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> hooks.</p>
<p>And I realized that learning in public can be a bit awkward, but more importantly, learning
by sharing is a great way to solidify what you learn.</p>
