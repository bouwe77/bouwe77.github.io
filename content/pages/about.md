Hi, I am Bouwe Westerdijk, an enthusiastic and experienced software engineer at
<a href="https://webinargeek.com" target="_blank">WebinarGeek</a> in The Netherlands.

I like learning new technologies and sharing what I learn by <a href="/blog">blogging</a> and
giving <a href="/workshops">workshops and presentations</a>.

At the moment I am working on <a href="/react">React</a>, GraphQL, .NET Core and Azure.
