## Resources

1. [https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html](TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers)
2. [The TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)

## Notes

### Any, unknown, never

According to TypeScript docs:
* any (allow anything)
* unknown (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is)
* never (itâ€™s not possible that this type could happen)

According to David K. Piano:

> Some useful tricks I use to help me remember when to use certain TypeScript types:
> 
> `unknown` = "don't know"
> `any` = "don't care"
> `never` = "don't want"
> `void` = "don't return"
