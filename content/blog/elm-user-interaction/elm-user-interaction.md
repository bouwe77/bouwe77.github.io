### Introduction

This is my third blog post about Elm. After writing about [the Elm language](/elm-baby-steps), I wrote about [rendering a UI with HTML](/elm-rendering-html). However, this didn't include any user interaction, so that's what we are going to do now.

When talking about user interaction in modern front end frameworks, _state_ is a very important topic. State is the data in your app that can (and will) change, which in turn makes the UI change as well. By separating state from UI, we can build declarative and flexible apps.

For Elm this means we have to look into the so-called Elm Architecture, which defines how to structure Elm apps so the Elm Runtime can take care of updating the UI when the state changes.

### Let's build an app

Let's build a very simple interactive app, while explaining and adhering to The Elm Architecture.

It's December, so let's build an Xmas app. Santa is preparing to leave to deliver presents, however, all presents are still in his workshop, and need to be loaded on his sleigh...

As you can see (right? 😏), on the left there the presents that are still in Santa's workshop, while on the right, there's Santa's sleigh, where all the presents should go.

By clicking on a present, it moves from the workshop to the sleigh, and vice versa.

### The view

One of the parts of The Elm Architecture is the UI, which Elm calls the View.

The HTML UI for our app looks as follows:

```
view model =
    div []
        [ h1 [] [ text "Let's Help Santa! 🎅🏻🙏🏻" ]
        , div [ class "container" ]
            [ div [ class "workshop" ]
                [ button [ id "present-2", class "present" ] []
                , button [ id "present-3", class "present" ] []
                ]
            , div [ class "sleigh" ]
                [ button [ id "present-1", class "present" ] []
                ]
            ]
        ]
```

We have a heading saying `"Let's Help Santa! 🎅🏻🙏🏻"`, and a bunch of `div`s: A `container`, which has 2 children, `"workshop"` and `"sleigh"`. Then there are 3 buttons, which are the "presents". `"present-1"` is already on the sleigh (child of the `"sleigh"` `div`), and the other two presents are still in the workshop, i.e. a child of the `"workshop"` `div`.

There is a bit of unnecessary duplication going on for the "presents", so let's create a function called `present` that renders the present `button`, and sets the `presentId` argument as the `id` attribute:

```
renderPresent presentId =
    button [ id presentId, class "present" ] []

view model =
    div []
        [ h1 [] [ text "Let's Help Santa! 🎅🏻🙏🏻" ]
        , div [ class "container" ]
            [ div [ class "workshop" ]
                [ renderPresent "present-2", renderPresent "present-3" ]
            , div [ class "sleigh" ]
                [ renderPresent "present-1" ]
            ]
        ]
```

If you read my previous blog post, you might notice a slight difference: Here. the HTML is defined in a function called `view`, that receives a `model` argument. It returns an HTML structure, kind of like we did before. In the HTML, we don't use the `model` argument yet. Then we call `main`, which calls the `view` and passes a string of `"todo"` as a dummy model for now.


### The initial model

The next part of the Elm Architecture is the model, which is the state of our application. In our case, it's a list of presents, and their location:

```
type Location
    = Workshop
    | Sleigh

type alias Present =
    { id : String, location : Location }

initialModel : List Present
initialModel =
    [ { id = "present-1", location = Workshop }
    , { id = "present-2", location = Workshop }
    , { id = "present-3", location = Workshop }
    ]
```

The `initialModel` is a list of `Present` records, where the `location` is either `Workshop` or `Sleigh`.

### Rendering the initial model

Now that we have an initial model, let's render that instead of the hard-coded elements:

```
view model =
    div []
        [ h1 [] [ text "Let's Help Santa! 🎅🏻🙏🏻" ]
        , div [ class "container" ]
            [ div [ class "workshop" ] (renderPresents model Workshop)
            , div [ class "sleigh" ] (renderPresents model Sleigh)
            ]
        ]
```

Notice how the hard-coded lists of presents have been replace by a call to `renderPresents`, which receives 2 arguments, the `model` (all of the presents), and a `Location` type to filter on of either `Workshop` or `Sleigh`.

This is the `renderPresents` function:

```
renderPresents presents locationFilter =
    List.map
        (\p -> renderPresent p.id)
        (List.filter (\p -> p.location == locationFilter) presents)
```

It receives the `presents`, which it filters with `List.filter` on the given `locationFilter`. The filtered presents is passed as the second argument to `List.map`, which only keeps the `id` of the present, because that's the only thing the `renderPresent` needs.

Note how I use parenthesis so Elm knows which arguments belong to which function call. You need to read this from the inside out: First there is the filter on `presents`, and then there is a map on the result.

We've used two list functions here, `List.filter` and `List.map`. There are a few things that are different when you are used to JavaScript:

- They are not _methods_ on a list, but instead independent functions where you pass the list to. Methods do not exist in Elm, there are only functions, which need to _receive_ all arguments.

- The list to filter or map on is the _second_ argument.

- The first argument of both functions is an anonymous function which defines what to apply on every item in the list. In Elm, anonymous functions start with a `\` (backslash), and we use the arrow `->` before returning.

### Updating the model

The third part of The Elm Architecture, next to View and Model, is Update. This is of course also a function, called `update`, which receives all of the information to update the model. After the model is updated, the Elm Runtime will update the UI, by applying the updated model to the view.

The `update` function needs two things to know what to do: The so-called message (`msg`), which specifies _what_ to do, and the `model` to change, depending on the `msg`:

```
-- ...
-- ...
```

Elm needs to know we've written the `update` function, so let's update the call to `main`:

```
import Browser

-- other code...

main =
    Browser.sandbox
        { init = initialModel
        , view = view
        , update = update
        }
```

We've imported `Browser`, and assign `Browser.sandbox` to `main`. This is Elm's way to indicate an app is interactive.

Notice how, with this change, we only pass `initialModel`, `view`, and `update`. The Elm Runtime will do the wiring for us, and keep everything in sync now. Here is how you see all of the parts of the Elm Architecture coming together.
