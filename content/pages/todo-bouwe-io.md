title: TO DO bouwe.io
---

These are improvements I want to do on bouwe.io, ordered on priority:

1. Better About Me text
1. Add videos (webinars) to RSS feed, or just write a short blog post so it appears automatically.
1. Content creation dashboard that shows stats/overview of kinds of content creation I did, when, and how many. To show how active I am, to/for myself, and possibly others.
1. Add date to blog post list(s)
1. Light & Dark mode
1. Better/more photo(s) of myself
1. Visitor stats
1. TIL page where I post short notes of things I've learned
