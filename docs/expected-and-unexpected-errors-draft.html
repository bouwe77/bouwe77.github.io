      <div><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The reason I write this blog post is that I have some thoughts about errors, and how to categorize and handle them. It is not based on any investigation, or study, these are just my thoughts, a way to look at errors, based on my own opinion and experience.</p>
<p>I deliberately made this post a bit abstract, so it does not depend or is related to any programming languages or frameworks you use.</p>
<p>I want to talk about the distinction between <em>expected</em> and <em>unexpected</em> errors.</p>
<p>But before I explain, first some terminology, what are we talking about?</p>
<h3>What is an error?</h3>
<p>The term one might use for errors depends on your programming language or framework, but in this blog post the errors I am talking about are also known as faults, or exceptions: Your code is running and suddenly something goes wrong and <strong>an error is thrown</strong> which causes your program (or a part of it) to stop functioning or responding properly.</p>
<p>No one wants errors, because they indicate something is wrong. Perhaps the only good thing about errors is that at least you know there is something to improve in your codebase. On the other hand, you can't prevent them from happening, so it's all about how to handle them.</p>
<p>If an error occurs, it most likely means something is not working, which might have an impact on your users. It could also be there is hardly (or no) impact, but in that case, they are at least distracting.</p>
<h3>How do you know errors occur?</h3>
<p>Most apps have some kind of logging in place, so when errors occur, we at least know.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the software, we might let the user know. In a UI, we might show a modal indicating something's gone wrong. In the case of an HTTP API, a specific error code might be returned, for example, a <code>400 Bad Request</code>.</p>
<p>It is also possible errors are not reported to the user, but only logged. Or, not logged, but only reported to the user. In that case, you are not <em>in control</em>, because you'll only know errors occur when users let you know, or even worse, complain about it.</p>
<p>It is even possible errors are not logged, and not reported. That is disastrous because then you are completely blind to what is happening on your platform.</p>
<p>Let's assume for now you want to know which errors happen (logging), and you want to give proper feedback to your users.</p>
<h3>What do errors even say?</h3>
<p>So you have an application, you know when errors occur, and you provide feedback to your users.</p>
<p>Does that mean that when there are no errors, your software works? Of course not, because you might be handling errors wrongly, or even worse, there are no errors, but the software is not working.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have a webshop, users can add products to their cart, but when they click the "Order Now" button nothing happens. No errors, just nothing happens. It appears some of the app's functionality has not been properly built, and/or tested, and now your company can not sell their products.</p>
<p>So errors can be an indication things are wrong, but no errors are not necessarily an indication nothing is wrong...</p>
<p>If something is not working as intended, regardless errors are thrown or not, then you have a <em>bug</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the way, throwing errors should not be used to control the flow of your application. In other words, as an easy way to exit a function by letting things crash, so you can catch them elsewhere. Errors should indicate things are wrong, an exception to the rule. If you want to quit processing because of a functional situation, just return early from the function by returning a return type that indicates what's wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be sure your software works well, and not only the happy flow but also how it handles errors is the reason why your software should be tested thoroughly.</p>
<p>And that brings me to <em>expected</em> and <em>unexpected</em> errors.</p>
<h3>Expected errors</h3>
<p>Expected errors are errors you know will happen and can not be prevented. For example, an application is communicating with another application, and somehow, a server is down, or the connection is gone. There are many ways to minimize the chance of this happening, but it will happen.</p>
<p>We just talked about logging, and while it might be interesting to log these kinds of problems, more importantly, there should be some kind of external monitoring in place to determine something is wrong and should be fixed. You'll need to have some kind of service that checks the health of your servers, network, and application, so you don't depend on logging to determine things are down.</p>
<p>Regarding feedback to the user, we all know the phrase "An error occurred, please try again". Often this feels (and is) not very helpful, but for expected errors, this might be actually quite useful because expected errors are often temporary. Chances are there was just a hiccup in the connection, or a standby server took over for a failing server, so recovering from the error by retrying a few seconds later might already help.</p>
<p>Expected errors can be predicted upfront, and therefore can and should be tested. You could, for example, shut down a server, disconnect the WiFi, make deliberate mistakes in config files, etc. and see how the application responds.</p>
<p>Expected errors can also be outside of your influence, for example when a user has a failing WiFi connection. There is nothing you can do about that, so logging has no use. Giving clear feedback, if you can, might, however.</p>
<h3>Unexpected errors</h3>
<p>Unexpected errors are annoying and hard.</p>
<p>Suppose you built and tested your application(s), everything is on production, and then an error occurs: The response from the API you called returns JSON in a structure that is not how your application expected it, so parsing fails with an error. Or a user enters data in a form, but the value is too long.</p>
<p>Of course, you want to check for values being too long, but an error should not be the way to indicate that. It's not an error situation, but a functional situation you want to check (validate) for.</p>
<p>These kinds of errors are unexpected because you have designed, built, and tested your application, based on documentation, meetings, or whatever. So everything should be good but isn't. This is what we call bugs.</p>
<p>You can not have any external monitoring in place, because you don't know what to monitor for, anything can go wrong. You've tested the application for what it <em>should</em> do, and not for things it <em>should not</em> do.</p>
<p>So for unexpected errors logging is very important: When it happens you want to know <em>what</em> and <em>where</em> it happened.</p>
<p>The error message "An error occurred, please try again" does not apply here. Unexpected errors are caused by bugs (programmer mistakes), so you can press that button as many times as you want, but chances are virtually zero it will somehow work later, without anyone changing anything in the source code of one of the applications involved.</p>
<h3>Differences between expected and unexpected errors</h3>
<p>Let's talk about the differences between expected and unexpected errors.</p>
<p>First of all, fixing expected errors, i.e. getting things up and running again, is adjusting things <em>outside</em> of the application(s) where the error occurred. For example, bringing things back online.</p>
<p>It could also be you have no influence on fixing it, for example when the external API you are calling is down, or when a user's WiFi connection is down.</p>
<p>So whatever the case with expected errors, the application source code does not need to be changed to make things work again.</p>
<p>And because the error is expected, you might be able to even give pretty detailed instructions on what went wrong and even what the user can do (if anything) to try again.</p>
<p>Unexpected errors, however, always need adjustment <em>inside</em> of the application(s) where things are going wrong.</p>
<p>If the user entered a too-long value in an input field, you could've built your app in such a way it just displays the error stack trace, which might give the user a clue on what they did wrong. However, that's not a good idea, and it's not the user's responsibility to fix it. A possible fix for this problem could be improving the form validation, so it is no longer possible for the user to enter a too-long value.</p>
<p>Because of these differences, handling expected and unexpected errors will happen in different places in the app. Expected errors are handled (caught) close to where they happen so you know the context and can give proper feedback.</p>
<p>Unexpected errors, however, are not caught in specific places (because they can happen anywhere) but should bubble up to a catch-all higher up in the code, so you can log a full stack trace. And you'll need that stack trace because unexpected errors often need to be investigated before they can be solved, so you want to collect as much information as possible.</p>
<h3>What all errors have in common</h3>
<p>There is one thing expected and unexpected errors have in common when handling them.</p>
<p>When an error occurs, the feedback to the user or caller should always be clear. What has happened, and what can the user do now? Even if it means the user can't do anything, then at least they know.</p>
<p>How detailed this feedback is depends on the situation of course. Giving too much detail might not always be helpful, or even lead to security issues.</p>
<p>For example, when you have a UI, and an error occurs, let the user know an error occurred. Maybe part of the UI can even still work, despite the error.</p>
<p>Or when you call an API, it is important you know it's an unexpected error, caused by a bug (4xx status code), or an expected (temporary) error (5xx status code), that might be worth retrying.</p>
<h3>Where should unexpected errors be fixed?</h3>
<p>Preventing and fixing unexpected errors is all about <em>cause</em> and <em>responsibility</em>.</p>
<p>For example, when an application calls an API with a GET request, the application can expect the response has a specific structure or even a contract so to say. This might be formally described in the documentation, generated code, or just word of mouth, but the structure is clear. Then the calling code can assume this structure is always correct.</p>
<p>When somehow the structure is suddenly not correct anymore, it's an unexpected error. Somewhere in one of our applications, the contract is broken. Or the old version of an application is still deployed.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, an error will (should) occur, because it is unexpected, and you want to know. This way, the error bubbles up to a certain place in the application and is logged, so people can check what went wrong.</p>
<p>The analysis of where the <em>cause</em> of the problem lies is important: You don't want to fix the client app when actually the API is wrong. If you fix things in the wrong place, for example, make the client app handle either correct or incorrect responses, you are obfuscating the real problem.</p>
<p>Of course, sometimes you are dependent on external parties, and a quick fix can be convenient but strive to prevent these kinds of things as it makes things brittle, unclear, and unmaintainable.</p>
<p>It is often the case an API, and the client consuming it, are built with different programming languages, so unexpected errors are common. By just sticking to the contract, you'll find issues earlier, most likely already when testing, so you'll ship robust code, and prevent as many unexpected errors as possible.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>My point is to not just put some try/catch statements here and there. Instead, identify what can go wrong (expected errors), handle them, test them, and give proper feedback.</p>
<p>Everything else (unexpected errors) should not be handled specifically, because you don't know where, when, and why they happen., but you want to know they happen, so catch them so you can give proper feedback, and log them, so you at least know something needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>So if you have a general, central catch-all where all errors end up, you can log them there., but because you handle the expected (known) errors in the place where they actually occur, these won't end up in the catch-all, making the catch-all the place for unexpected (yet unknown) errors only.</p>
<p>And if you fix something, try to fix it in the right place.</p>
