#### Introduction

From the moment I started learning React I also started teaching React to others by blogging and giving workshops and talks.

#### Blog posts

Blog posts about my workshops are filed under the [Workshops category].

#### Podcasts

I host 2 podcasts about coding, testing, architecture, content creation, career, etc.:

1. [Bouwe's Briefs](https://anchor.fm/bouwe77) is my own podcast, where I ramble, and try to keep it short.
2. [Curious Coders Chronicles](https://anchor.fm/curious-coder) is a podcast I host together with [Rich](https://richstone.io), where we, and our ocassional guests, talk about the things we are curious about.
