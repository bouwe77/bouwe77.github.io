            <div class="w3-container"><p>Now my site is live I will publish my first blog posts. Until now, I wrote my blog posts for the first days
of the coding challenge in a Google Drive document. Today I will paste them into my Gatsby blog and use it from now on.</p>
<p>The site that I use uses markdown for writing pages and posts. So what you basically do is create a markdown file
for each blog post and place it in the designated folder. This markdown file consists of metadata and the actual blog post.
As soon as Gatsby notices a new file was created it is automatically added and displayed on the site. So today I created 3
blog posts, for days 0, 1 and 2 of my 100 days of Code challenge.</p>
<p>Let me tell you some more about my development environment. I started with CodeSandbox, but I soon realized that my Gatsby
site does not work there. I expected that every change I made in either the Gatsby code or when writing pages or posts would
immediately be reflected on the website I see in the CodeSandbox preview pane. This is unfortunately not the case so I switched
to Visual Studio Code. How I work now is pushing changes from VS Code to Github and wait for Netlify to deploy these changes.</p>
<p>It would be better to have a local development environment and push the changes to Github &#x26; Netlify as soon as they are ready
to publish. That would speed up the development process and prevent the live site from having bugs as I am experimenting with
Gatsby. But that's something to fix later. Today I have published some blog posts and I tweaked the layout of the website to
make it look better.</p>
