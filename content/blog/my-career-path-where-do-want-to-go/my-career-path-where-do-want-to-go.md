Today I joined a community where senior developers discuss and coach each other into defining their career goals. Think of sharing experiences, help and motivate each other to reach their goals, and hold each other accountable.

When joining the community, you are asked to introduce yourself, tell what you've done, where you are now, and what your ambitions are.

I consider myself to be a senior developer, if only because of my age... 😏 But I also consider myself not being super ambitious. I am doing specific senior-like things both in my work and free time (more on that later), and have some loose ideas on what else I want to do and achieve, but I don't have a very clear goal which role I think I should have in 5 or 10 years from now. Many developers of my age aspire a C-level role.

> Today I learned that C-level means being a "chief", for example a CTO, CEO, etc.

But I do think I perhaps should be more aware and conscious of my career path, which is why I think it's good and interesting to join this community as a way to explore this.

I decided to write my introduction here, as a blog post, and then copy-paste it to the community as well, because I think it's to have on my own website as well:
