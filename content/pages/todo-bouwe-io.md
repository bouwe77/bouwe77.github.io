title: TO DO bouwe.io
---

In order of priority:

1. From a blog post, navigate to the previous and next blog post

1. Replace Node preview app by an http-serve command

1. Check RSS update: does it only update when necessary?

1. Better/more photo(s) of myself

1. Resume (just a normal Markdown page, but hide it so I can customize it for specific situations)

1. Lighthouse improvements

1. Better About Me text

1. Content creation dashboard that shows stats/overview of kinds of content creation I did, when, and how many. To show how active I am, for myself, and possibly others. Example: https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/stats
The publish script should create a "data structure" that can be queried, so a static page with all sorts of statistics can be created.

1. TIL page where I post short notes of things I've learned

### DONE
1. ~~Light & Dark mode~~
1. ~~Remove contact page and move content to about page~~
1. ~~Visitor stats~~
1. ~~Draft blogs and pages: Add underscore of the folder or file name to NOT publish it~~
