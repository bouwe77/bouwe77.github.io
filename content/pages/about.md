Hi, I am Bouwe Westerdijk, an enthusiastic and experienced senior software engineer at
<a href="https://newnexus.nl" target="_blank">New Nexus</a> in The Netherlands.

I like learning new technologies and sharing what I learn by <a href="/blog">blogging</a> and
giving <a href="/workshops">workshops and presentations</a>.

At the moment I am working on <a href="/react">React</a>, GraphQL, .NET Core and Azure.
