title: TO DO bouwe.io
---

### MUST HAVE
1. Light & Dark mode

### SHOULD HAVE
1. From a blog post, navigate to the previous and next blog post
1. Replace Node preview app by an http-serve command
1. Check RSS update: does it only update when necessary?

### COULD HAVE
1. Better About Me text
1. Content creation dashboard that shows stats/overview of kinds of content creation I did, when, and how many. To show how active I am, for myself, and possibly others. Example: https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/stats
The publish script should create a "data structure" that can be queried, so a static page with all sorts of statistics can be created.
1. TIL page where I post short notes of things I've learned
1. Better/more photo(s) of myself

### DONE
1. ~~Remove contact page and move content to about page~~
1. ~~Visitor stats~~
1. ~~Draft blogs and pages: Add underscore of the folder or file name to NOT publish it~~
